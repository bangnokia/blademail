# blademail

Blade Mail is an Local SMTP desktop app for debugging and previewing your emails.

This is the repository of the Blade Mail app. If you like this app, you can buy at [blademail.app](https://blademail.app). I'm only selling the built version of this app.

**This is not Electron!**, and file size is small!
